# 📊 NYSE S\&P 500 Financial Analysis — Personal Excel/Sheets Project

## 💼 Project Overview

This is a personal data analysis project where I explored real-world financial data from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), specifically focusing on companies listed in the S\&P 500 index. The dataset was originally sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgawlik/nyse), and I worked with a cleaned subset that includes key financial and sector data across hundreds of publicly traded companies.

## 🔍 Objective

The main goal of this project is to:

* Analyze historical financial data to uncover business insights
* Calculate summary statistics and important financial metrics
* Build a dynamic **Profit and Loss Dashboard**
* Develop a **financial forecast model** using scenario planning
* Communicate findings visually through a presentation

This project allowed me to blend my skills in data analytics, financial modeling, and Excel/Google Sheets automation.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

* ✅ Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, variance, range)
* ✅ Excel functions: `IF`, `INDEX`, `MATCH`, `OFFSET`, `VLOOKUP`, `XLOOKUP`, conditional formatting, dropdowns, data validation
* ✅ Data visualization using charts, slicers, and dynamic filters
* ✅ Business metrics analysis and financial forecasting
* ✅ Presentation and storytelling with data (PowerPoint/PDF format)

## 🗃️ Dataset

The project utilizes a combination of:

* `Fundamentals.csv` — Core financial metrics from SEC 10K filings
* `Securities.csv` — Company metadata including sector and sub-industry

These files were pre-cleaned and structured to allow for efficient analysis.
