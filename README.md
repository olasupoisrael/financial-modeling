# 📊 NYSE S\&P 500 Financial Analysis — Personal Excel Project

## 💼 Project Overview

This is a personal data analysis project where I explored real-world financial data from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), specifically focusing on companies listed in the S\&P 500 index. The dataset was originally sourced from Kaggle:
🔗 [Kaggle - New York Stock Exchange Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgawlik/nyse)

## 🔍 Objective

The main goal of this project is to:

* Analyze historical financial data to uncover business insights
* Calculate summary statistics and important financial metrics
* Build a dynamic **Profit and Loss Dashboard**
* Develop a **financial forecast model** using scenario planning
* Communicate findings visually through a presentation

This project allowed me to blend my skills in data analytics, financial modeling, and Excel automation.

## 🧹 Cleaning Up the Data

The original files from Kaggle's NYSE S\&P 500 dataset included numerous raw and unstructured elements. To streamline the analysis:

* A **curated, clean version** of the dataset was provided specifically for this project.
* No extensive data cleaning was required, but I reviewed and noted best practices for future reference.

### 🔧 Suggested Cleaning Steps (for raw data users):

* Remove the **first column** with no header (just a row count).
* Check and remove any **special characters** in cell values.
* **Rename column headers** by removing spaces and special characters (e.g., commas), which improves compatibility for formulas and scripting.

### 🗃️ Final Dataset Includes:

* `Ticker Symbol`: Company’s trading symbol
* `Years`: Year label for each reporting period
* `Period Ending`: Fiscal year-end date
* `Total Revenue`: Annual revenue in USD
* `Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)`: Annual COGS in USD
* `Sales, General & Administrative (SGA)`: Annual SG\&A expenses in USD
* `Research and Development`: Annual R\&D expenses
* `Other Operating Items`: Miscellaneous operating expenses
* `GICS Sector` and `GICS Sub-Industry`: No changes made
